##### Java implementation of a Pascal compiler

This project is so general, I'm not even going to name it. Well I guess I can go with JIoPC.

Just your run-of-the-mill from-scratch top-down parsing stuff, implemented in Java for fun and learning.

Written with help and inspiration of the third edition of *"Writing Compilers and Interpreters: A Software Engineering Approach"* by Ronald Mak.

Contains a parsing frontend, and then compiler and interpreter on backend.

Since tests classes usually contain abnormal number of methods, decided to use 'calvin s' ASCII font to mark test sections.
